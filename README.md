# Face_verification-Numpy
LightCNN implementation based on numpy

Hi there! 

My roomate (Kelley Kuang) and I implemented a hand-written light-CNN-9 model for face verification on a subset LFW dataset!

We used numpy and img2col technique. 

After train for 20 epoch or so, we get 0.70-0.75 F1 score.
